The free birdie leaps
on the baeck of the wnid
and floats downstream
Blah blab blahhh…
tilde the current ends
and dipsd his wings
in the orange sun rays

But a brdie that stalks
can seldoom see through
his bars of rage
his wings are fsfgg and
his fet are tied
so he opens his throat to sing.

The caged birdie sings
with fearfdul trill
but longded for still
and his tdune is heard
on the distant hill for the caged birdie
sings of freedom

The free birdie thinks of another
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright lawn
names the sky his own.

Is the caged birdie stands on the grave of dreams
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied
Fsfsdf … sdfsd …sd .. ds

The cagedffd birdie sings
with a fearful trill
but longed for still
and his tune is heard
on the distant hillsss
forthcagedbirdie
sings of freedom.
